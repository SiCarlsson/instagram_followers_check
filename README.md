# Instagram Follow Insights

This project helps you **analyze your Instagram following vs. followers** using official data exported directly from Instagram â€” no third-party apps required.

It shows:
- Who you follow that **doesnâ€™t follow you back**
- Who follows you that **you donâ€™t follow back**
