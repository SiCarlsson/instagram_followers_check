# Instagram Followers Insights

This project helps you **analyze your Instagram following vs. followers** using official data exported directly from Instagram â€” no third-party apps required. 

This program only parses your exported **JSON data** and does **not connect to Instagram**.

It shows:
- Who you follow that **doesnâ€™t follow you back**.
- Who follows you that **you donâ€™t follow back**.
